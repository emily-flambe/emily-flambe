## 🏆 Github Projects

These are for fun and education - or at least they better be, because I'm sure not making any money off of them. Also: I used to have these deployed on AWS, and then I ran out of AWS Free Tier resources 🫠

### ✂️ [List Cutter]([https://list-cutter.emilyflam.be](https://github.com/emily-flambe/list-cutter))
A web app that helps you cut lists from CSV files using user-provided filters provided in SQL-like WHERE logic. **Django** backend, **React** frontend, deployed on **AWS EC2**.

This is NOT a CRM.... or is it?

### ♟️ [Chesscom Helper](https://github.com/emily-flambe/chesscom-helper)
A web app that uses the [Chess.com API](https://www.chess.com/news/view/published-data-api) to do... things. I have plans, I promise, but it's still a work in progress. Built with a **Django** backend and **React** frontend using **Material-UI**, containerized with **Docker** and deployed on **AWS EC2**.

### 🤖 [Ask Reddit Without Asking Reddit](https://github.com/emily-flambe/ask-reddit-without-asking-reddit)
This web application uses the power of (so-called) "Artificial Intelligence" (dubious!) to query Reddit and summarize the content of posts in order to "answer" questions. (Note: this really doesn't work well at all, but I had fun playing with the OpenAI and Reddit APIs.)
